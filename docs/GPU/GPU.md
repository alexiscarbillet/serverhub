# How a GPU Works

A **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** is a specialized processor designed to handle multiple tasks in parallel. While originally built for rendering images and videos, GPUs are now widely used in **servers**, **scientific computing**, **AI**, and **cloud infrastructure**.

## 1. CPU vs GPU: Different Design Philosophies

Unlike a **CPU** (Central Processing Unit), which has a few powerful cores optimized for sequential tasks, a **GPU** has thousands of smaller cores optimized for **parallel workloads**.

| Feature              | CPU                              | GPU                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Cores                 | Few (4‚Äì64)                        | Hundreds to thousands                        |
| Strength              | Sequential processing             | Parallel processing                          |
| Typical Use           | General computing, OS tasks       | Rendering, AI, simulations, data processing  |
| Latency               | Low                               | Higher                                       |
| Throughput            | Moderate                          | Very high                                   |

This parallelism makes GPUs ideal for workloads like:
- AI and Machine Learning
- Scientific simulations
- Data analytics
- High-performance rendering
- Video transcoding

## 2. GPU Architecture Overview

A typical GPU consists of:

- **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**: Clusters of small cores that execute threads in parallel.
- **Memory Controllers**: Manage access to high-bandwidth VRAM (Video RAM).
- **Scheduler**: Distributes tasks to cores efficiently.
- **PCIe Interface**: Allows data transfer between CPU and GPU.
- **Cooling & Power Components**: Maintain performance under heavy load.

The **SMs** are what allow the GPU to perform thousands of calculations simultaneously.

## 3. The Processing Workflow

Here‚Äôs a simplified view of how a GPU processes data on a server:

1. **Task Submission**  
   The CPU sends a workload (e.g., matrix computation, rendering job) to the GPU driver.

2. **Data Transfer**  
   Input data is transferred from **system RAM** to **VRAM** through the PCIe bus.

3. **Parallel Execution**  
   The GPU splits the job into thousands of threads executed by SMs.

4. **Result Collection**  
   Once completed, the results are sent back to system memory or stored on the GPU for further processing.

## 4. GPU Memory (VRAM)

GPUs use **VRAM (Video RAM)**, which has high bandwidth compared to system memory.  
This allows for fast data access but requires careful memory management, especially in multi-GPU or server environments.

| Memory Type | Typical Bandwidth | Use Case                             |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| GDDR6       | High              | Gaming, AI inferencing                 |
| HBM2e       | Very High         | HPC, AI training, data centers         |
| GDDR5       | Moderate          | Entry-level workloads                  |

## 5. GPU in Servers

In server environments, GPUs are not just for graphics. They accelerate compute-intensive tasks like:

- Deep learning training (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Real-time rendering
- Parallel processing for analytics
- Cryptographic computations
- Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

Many modern servers use **multiple GPUs** connected through:
- **PCIe Gen4/Gen5**
- **NVLink** (NVIDIA)
- **Infinity Fabric** (AMD)

This enables massive parallelism for enterprise workloads.

## 6. Software & Drivers

GPUs require specialized software to interact efficiently with the system:

- **CUDA** (NVIDIA) or **ROCm** (AMD) for compute acceleration
- **OpenCL** for vendor-agnostic workloads
- **Drivers** for OS and kernel integration
- **Container support** (e.g., NVIDIA Container Toolkit)

> üí° **Tip:** On Linux servers, installing the correct driver version is essential for GPU stability and performance.

## 7. Virtualization & GPU Sharing

Modern data centers often **virtualize** GPUs to optimize usage:

- **vGPU (Virtual GPU)** allows multiple VMs to share a single physical GPU.
- **SR-IOV** and **MIG (Multi-Instance GPU)** are used to securely isolate workloads.
- Useful for **VDI**, AI inference, or rendering farms.

## 8. Monitoring & Maintenance

To keep GPUs healthy in server environments:

- Monitor **temperature**, **power usage**, and **memory utilization** using tools like:
  - `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA)
  - `rocm-smi` (AMD)
- Use proper cooling and airflow
- Regularly update drivers and firmware
- Schedule maintenance windows for heavy workloads

## 9. Common Server GPU Models

| Model                | VRAM | Compute Capability | Typical Use                |
|-----------------------|------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| NVIDIA A100           | 80 GB HBM2e | HPC, AI training       | Data centers |
| NVIDIA L40S           | 48 GB GDDR6 | Rendering, inference    | Enterprise AI |
| AMD MI300X            | 192 GB HBM3 | HPC, AI workloads       | HPC clusters |
| NVIDIA T4             | 16 GB GDDR6 | Inference, VDI          | Edge/Cloud  |

## 10. Conclusion

A GPU is more than just a graphics card‚Äîit‚Äôs a **parallel computing powerhouse**.  
On servers, it enables:
- Faster computation
- Energy-efficient scaling
- Advanced workloads like AI and scientific simulations

Understanding how GPUs work is the first step in **optimizing your server infrastructure** for modern applications.
