### üõ†Ô∏è Performance Overview

The B650MT is equipped with a 6-phase VRM design, suitable for mainstream Ryzen processors with a TDP of 65W to 105W. However, when paired with high-end chips like the Ryzen 9 7950X, the VRM's thermal performance may be insufficient, potentially leading to throttling under heavy loads.

Memory overclocking is another area where the B650MT shows limitations. Despite official support for DDR5 speeds up to 6000+ MHz, achieving stable operation beyond 5600 MHz can be challenging, particularly with integrated graphics setups that benefit from higher memory bandwidth.
