* Supports single and mixed precision workloads, including FP32, FP16, and TensorFloat-32 for maximum AI performance.

### 2. **High-Performance CPUs**

* Powered by **Intel Xeon Scalable processors**, providing strong CPU support alongside GPUs.
* Enables balanced CPU-GPU performance for training and inference workloads.

### 3. **Massive GPU Memory**

* Each NVIDIA A100 GPU provides up to **40 GB of high-bandwidth memory**, supporting large-scale AI and deep learning models.
* Ideal for training deep neural networks and running inference with large datasets.

### 4. **High-Speed Networking**

* Up to **100 Gbps network bandwidth** for multi-GPU communication and distributed training.
* Optimized for GPU clusters and large-scale model parallelism.

### 5. **Flexible Machine Types**

* Supports **predefined machine types** (e.g., a2-highgpu-1g) and **custom machine types** for GPU, vCPU, and memory allocation.
* Allows scaling from single GPU workloads to multi-GPU clusters for enterprise AI.

### 6. **Integration with GCP Services**

* Compatible with **AI Platform, Cloud Storage, BigQuery**, and other Google Cloud services.
