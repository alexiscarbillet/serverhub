Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers the **C2D instance family**, a compute-optimized virtual machine series powered by **AMD EPYC Milan processors**. C2D instances are designed for high-performance, CPU-intensive workloads, providing excellent price-to-performance for modern compute tasks.

## Key Features of C2D Instances

### 1. **Powered by AMD EPYC Milan CPUs**

* C2D instances leverage AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” processors, offering high core counts and memory bandwidth.
* Provides up to **224 vCPUs** per instance, making it ideal for multi-threaded workloads.

### 2. **Optimized for Compute-Intensive Workloads**

* High vCPU-to-memory ratio ensures maximum compute performance per dollar.
* Suitable for HPC, rendering, simulation, and financial analytics workloads.

### 3. **Flexible Machine Types**

* Supports **predefined machine types** (e.g., c2d-standard-4) and **custom machine types** to adjust memory per vCPU.
* Allows precise tailoring of resources to your workload and budget.

### 4. **High Network Bandwidth**

* Up to **32 Gbps network throughput**, supporting low-latency communication for distributed workloads.
* Ideal for clustered databases, HPC clusters, and parallelized applications.

### 5. **Integration with GCP Ecosystem**

* Compatible with **Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud SQL**, and other Google Cloud services.
* Live migration support ensures high availability and resilience during maintenance.

## Use Cases

* **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Scientific simulations, engineering computations, and analytics.
* **Rendering and Media Processing:** 3D rendering, video encoding, and graphics-intensive workloads.
* **Financial Applications:** Risk calculations, quantitative analysis, and real-time financial modeling.
* **Enterprise Applications:** Compute-heavy ERP, CRM, and backend processing.
