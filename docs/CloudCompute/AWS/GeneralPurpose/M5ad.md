# Exploring AWS M5ad Instances: General Purpose with Local NVMe Storage

When it comes to Amazon EC2 instances, AWS offers a wide range of flavors tailored to specific needs. For workloads that require both **general-purpose compute power** and **fast local storage**, the **M5ad instances** stand out. Built on AMD EPYC processors and equipped with NVMe-based SSD storage, they deliver a balance of price, performance, and storage flexibility.

## What Are M5ad Instances?

The **M5ad family** belongs to AWS’s **M5 general-purpose line**, similar to M5a instances, but with an added twist:

* They are powered by **AMD EPYC 7000 series processors** (up to 2.5 GHz).
* They include **local NVMe SSD instance storage**, physically attached to the host server.

This makes them a great option for workloads that need low-latency, high-speed storage in addition to balanced compute and memory resources.

## Key Features

* **Processor**: AMD EPYC 7000 series (up to 2.5 GHz)
* **vCPUs**: 2 – 96, depending on the instance size
* **Memory**: 8 GiB per vCPU (same ratio as M5a)
* **Local Storage**: NVMe-based SSDs included with each instance
* **EBS-Optimized**: Support for high-throughput Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* **Networking**: Up to 25 Gbps with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
* **Built on Nitro**: AWS Nitro System for improved security and performance

## Instance Sizes

Like M5a, M5ad instances come in various sizes, but each size also includes local NVMe SSD storage:

* **m5ad.large** – 2 vCPUs, 8 GiB RAM, 1 × 75 GB NVMe SSD
* **m5ad.xlarge** – 4 vCPUs, 16 GiB RAM, 1 × 150 GB NVMe SSD
* **m5ad.2xlarge** – 8 vCPUs, 32 GiB RAM, 1 × 300 GB NVMe SSD
* **m5ad.4xlarge** – 16 vCPUs, 64 GiB RAM, 2 × 300 GB NVMe SSDs
* **m5ad.8xlarge** – 32 vCPUs, 128 GiB RAM, 2 × 600 GB NVMe SSDs
* **m5ad.12xlarge** – 48 vCPUs, 192 GiB RAM, 2 × 900 GB NVMe SSDs
* **m5ad.16xlarge** – 64 vCPUs, 256 GiB RAM, 4 × 600 GB NVMe SSDs
* **m5ad.24xlarge** – 96 vCPUs, 384 GiB RAM, 4 × 900 GB NVMe SSDs

## Use Cases

M5ad instances are best suited for **applications that require both compute and low-latency storage**. Common scenarios include:

* **Caching and temporary data storage** – Fast NVMe storage is ideal for short-lived or temporary data.
* **Data logging and processing** – Local SSDs help handle bursty I/O workloads.
* **Gaming servers** – Benefit from high-speed storage and compute balance.
* **Media processing and rendering** – NVMe storage helps with large files and temporary data.
* **Databases** – Useful for workloads where fast local storage is beneficial, such as NoSQL or cache databases.

## Benefits of Choosing M5ad

1. **Cost Savings** – Like M5a, M5ad is typically up to **10% cheaper** than Intel-based M5d instances.
2. **Local NVMe Storage** – High-speed SSD storage for workloads that need fast disk I/O.
3. **Balanced Performance** – Equal memory-to-vCPU ratio as M5/M5a, making them versatile.
4. **Scalability** – Available in sizes suitable for both small and large workloads.

---

## M5ad vs. Other M5 Variants

* **M5a** – Cheaper general-purpose instances, but no local NVMe storage.
* **M5ad** – Same as M5a, but with NVMe SSDs included.
* **M5d** – Intel-based equivalent with NVMe storage, generally more expensive.

---

## Things to Keep in Mind

* **Ephemeral Storage**: NVMe instance storage is **not persistent**. Data is lost if the instance stops, hibernates, or terminates. Always use Amazon EBS or S3 for permanent storage needs.
* **Workload Fit**: M5ad makes sense only if your workload can benefit from **fast local disk access**. If not, M5a might be the more cost-effective choice.

---

## Conclusion

AWS M5ad instances combine the affordability of AMD EPYC processors with the performance benefits of local NVMe SSD storage. They provide a strong option for workloads that require both compute flexibility and low-latency storage, such as gaming, caching, and media processing.

If you’re already considering M5a instances but need **high-speed local storage**, M5ad offers the perfect balance between **performance, storage, and cost savings**.
