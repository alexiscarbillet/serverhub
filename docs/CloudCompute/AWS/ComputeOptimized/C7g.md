# AWS C7g Instances: Next-Generation Compute with AWS Graviton3

AWS has steadily evolved its compute-optimized EC2 families to deliver higher performance and better cost efficiency. The **C7g family** is the latest in this line, powered by the **AWS Graviton3 processors**—custom silicon designed by AWS using Arm architecture. With significant performance improvements over Graviton2-based C6g instances, C7g is ideal for modern compute-intensive workloads.

## What Are C7g Instances?

C7g instances are **compute-optimized EC2 instances** that leverage the **third-generation AWS Graviton3 processors**. These processors deliver:

* **Up to 25% better performance** over Graviton2 (C6g).
* **Up to 2× better floating-point performance**—critical for scientific and AI workloads.
* **Up to 2× faster cryptographic performance**—ideal for security-sensitive applications.
* **Up to 3× better machine learning (ML) inference performance** compared to Graviton2.

## Key Features

* **Processor**: AWS Graviton3 (64-bit Arm Neoverse V1 cores)
* **Architecture**: Arm-based (AArch64)
* **vCPUs**: From 1 to 64 depending on instance size
* **Memory**: 2 GiB per vCPU (same ratio as C6g)
* **Networking**: Up to 30 Gbps with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
* **EBS Bandwidth**: Up to 20 Gbps
* **Nitro System**: Secure, lightweight hypervisor with hardware acceleration
* **Sustainability**: Up to 60% less energy usage for the same performance compared to comparable x86 instances

## Instance Sizes

C7g instances come in a variety of sizes to suit different workloads:

* **c7g.medium** – 1 vCPU, 2 GiB RAM
* **c7g.large** – 2 vCPUs, 4 GiB RAM
* **c7g.xlarge** – 4 vCPUs, 8 GiB RAM
* **c7g.2xlarge** – 8 vCPUs, 16 GiB RAM
* **c7g.4xlarge** – 16 vCPUs, 32 GiB RAM
* **c7g.8xlarge** – 32 vCPUs, 64 GiB RAM
* **c7g.12xlarge** – 48 vCPUs, 96 GiB RAM
* **c7g.16xlarge** – 64 vCPUs, 128 GiB RAM

## Use Cases

C7g instances are ideal for **modern compute-heavy applications** where performance and efficiency are critical:

* **High-performance computing (HPC)**
* **Machine learning inference**
* **Scientific modeling and simulations**
* **Media encoding and transcoding**
* **Cryptographic workloads** (TLS termination, VPNs, data encryption)
* **Web servers, microservices, and containerized applications**

## Benefits of Choosing C7g

1. **Next-Level Performance** – Faster than C6g, especially for floating-point, cryptographic, and ML workloads.
2. **Energy Efficiency** – Up to **60% less energy usage**, aligning with sustainability goals.
3. **Cost Savings** – Better price-performance compared to x86 instances.
4. **Scalability** – From small microservices to large-scale compute clusters.
5. **Future-Proof** – Designed for modern workloads that benefit from specialized acceleration.

## C7g vs. Other Compute-Optimized Families

* **C6g** – Graviton2-powered, cost-efficient but slower than C7g.
* **C7g** – Graviton3-powered, offering the **best Arm performance** for compute workloads.
* **C6i** – Intel Xeon Scalable (x86), for workloads requiring Intel-specific features.
* **C6a** – AMD EPYC (x86), generally cheaper than Intel but less efficient than Graviton.

If your workloads are **Arm-compatible** and performance-critical, **C7g is the best option today**.

---

## Things to Keep in Mind

* **Arm Compatibility** – Like C6g, applications must be compiled for Arm64 (AArch64). Most modern stacks already support this (Docker, Kubernetes, major Linux distros, databases, and runtimes like Python, Java, Node.js, etc.).
* **Memory Ratio** – Same as C6g (2 GiB per vCPU). If you need higher memory per vCPU, consider general-purpose (M7g) or memory-optimized (R7g) families.

## Conclusion

AWS C7g instances represent a leap forward in **compute-optimized performance**, powered by the **Graviton3 processor**. With substantial improvements in floating-point, cryptography, and ML inference, they enable businesses to run demanding workloads more efficiently and at lower cost.

For organizations aiming to combine **performance, sustainability, and cost efficiency**, C7g stands out as the **flagship compute-optimized Arm option** on AWS.
