## About the author

Hello, I am Alexis Carbillet and this is my fifth website. I thought it would be fun to talk about electricity while using mkdocs, so here we are.

I coded from scratch my other websites.

- The First one is [ac-programming.com](https://ac-programming.com/), which is related to different fields of IT and contains most of my personnal projects in this field.

- The second one is [all-about-cats.uk](https://all-about-cats.uk/), which is about cats and their features.

- The third one, [alexis-carbillet.com](https://alexis-carbillet.com/), contains all the links to my work available online as well as a summary of my professional experiences.

- The last one is [ac-electrity.com](https://ac-electricity.com/). It allows you to learn about electricity, the concepts behind and how it it used everyday.
