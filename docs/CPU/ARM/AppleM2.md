## Key Characteristics

- **Architecture**: ARMv8.5-A (64-bit RISC)
- **Manufacturing process**: 5 nm (enhanced second-generation)
- **Transistor count**: ~20 billion
- **Cores**:
  - **CPU**: 8 cores
    - 4 high-performance cores
    - 4 high-efficiency cores
  - **GPU**: up to 10 cores (depending on model)
  - **Neural Engine**: 16-core machine learning accelerator

## What Makes the M2 Special?

1. **Enhanced Unified Memory**  
   - Supports **higher memory bandwidth** (~100 GB/s vs ~68 GB/s on M1).  
   - Larger memory pool allows handling of more complex workloads (video editing, 3D rendering, ML).

2. **Improved CPU & GPU Performance**  
   - Faster cores with improved instruction pipelines.  
   - More GPU cores for graphics-intensive tasks.  

3. **Neural Engine & Media Engine Upgrades**  
   - Neural Engine retains 16 cores but achieves **higher throughput** for AI/ML tasks.  
   - Media engine now supports **ProRes acceleration**, enabling smoother video editing.

4. **Efficiency**  
   - Maintains M1-level energy efficiency despite higher performance.  
   - Enables fanless designs (MacBook Air) while delivering desktop-class performance.

## Comparison to M1 and x86 CPUs

- **M1 vs M2**:  
  - CPU ~18% faster  
  - GPU up to 35% faster  
  - Supports higher RAM and memory bandwidth  
- **M2 vs Intel/AMD**:  
  - Still much more energy-efficient per watt  
  - Performs competitively or better than 11th-gen Intel Core mobile CPUs in most benchmarks  
  - AI/ML workloads benefit significantly from the integrated Neural Engine
