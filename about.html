            <h1 class="title">RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)</h1>

            <p><strong>RAID</strong> is a technology that combines multiple hard drives or SSDs into a single unit to improve performance, redundancy, or both. The term "RAID" refers to different configurations of how drives are arranged, each offering varying levels of data protection and speed.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 3%;">Types of RAID</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RAID 0 (Striping)</strong>: This configuration splits data into smaller chunks and writes them across two or more disks. This increases performance but offers no redundancy, meaning if one disk fails, all data is lost.</li>
                <li><strong>RAID 1 (Mirroring)</strong>: Data is mirrored on two or more disks. This provides redundancy, meaning if one disk fails, data is still available on another disk. Performance is typically lower than RAID 0 due to duplication of data.</li>
                <li><strong>RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)</strong>: Data and parity (error-correcting information) are striped across three or more disks. This offers a good balance between redundancy and performance. If one disk fails, the data can be reconstructed using parity information.</li>
                <li><strong>RAID 10 (1+0)</strong>: This combines RAID 1 and RAID 0. It mirrors data across pairs of disks and stripes across those pairs. RAID 10 offers both high performance and redundancy but requires a minimum of four disks.</li>
                <li><strong>RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)</strong>: Similar to RAID 5, but with two sets of parity, allowing for the failure of two disks instead of one. It offers high redundancy but has slower write speeds due to the double parity calculation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 3%;">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RAID 0</strong>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Very fast performance as data is striped across multiple drives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> No redundancy; data is lost if any drive fails.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>RAID 1</strong>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High redundancy as data is mirrored. Easy recovery in case of disk failure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Requires double the storage capacity, as data is duplicated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>RAID 5</strong>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good balance of performance and redundancy. Efficient storage utilization with parity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Performance can suffer during rebuilds, and it requires at least three disks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>RAID 10</strong>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Combines the performance of RAID 0 with the redundancy of RAID 1. Ideal for high-performance and critical data environments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Requires at least four disks, and storage capacity is reduced due to mirroring.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>RAID 6</strong>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Can tolerate the failure of two disks, offering strong redundancy for critical data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Slower write performance due to double parity and requires at least four disks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 3%;">Which RAID Levels are Most Used in Enterprises?</h2>
            <p>In enterprise environments, RAID 5 and RAID 10 are the most commonly used. RAID 5 provides a good balance of redundancy and performance, making it suitable for environments where uptime and performance are crucial, such as databases and file storage systems. RAID 10 is often used when high performance and data redundancy are both required, such as in web servers or transactional systems. RAID 6, while offering high redundancy, is less commonly used due to its slower write speeds.</p>
